        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">ASKA: Adaptive Secure Kernel Architecture</h1>
        
        <p className="lead mb-8">
          ASKA represents a paradigm shift in secure computing, offering a fundamentally new approach to building secure applications. At its core lies a multi-kernel design utilizing Modular Isolated Execution Stacks (IES), each providing complete hardware-enforced isolation for applications and processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Components</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Hardware-Enforced Isolation</h3>
        <p>
          ASKA&apos;s hardware-level compartmentalization minimizes the impact of vulnerabilities, preventing lateral movement of attacks and effectively containing breaches within individual IES instances. This robust isolation is enhanced by a sophisticated capability-based access control system, dynamically managed by the Dynamic Trust Management System (DTMS).
        </p>

        <h3>2. Multi-Layered Networking Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Two distinct networks operate independently:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Decentralized Mesh Network on Chip (DMNoC) for high-bandwidth, low-latency, peer-to-peer communication</li>
          <li>A Multi-Channel Network (MCN) for mediating interaction with external networks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. AI-Driven Security</h3>
        <p>
          The foundation of ASKA&apos;s adaptive security model rests on the powerful synergy between its multi-agent AI system and dynamic networking capabilities. AI Agents, deployed within isolated execution environments, monitor user interactions and analyze system-wide data for early threat detection and automated response.
        </p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          A purpose-built, integrated application development process completes ASKA&apos;s ecosystem. The AI Agent acts as a secure, out-of-band guide for developers, assisting with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Code generation and security analysis</li>
          <li>Deployment within the ASKA environment</li>
          <li>Interactive tutorials and best practices</li>
          <li>Continuous security monitoring and updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Impact</h2>
        <p>
          ASKA addresses numerous vulnerabilities present in traditional architectures through its unique combination of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hardware-enforced isolation</li>
          <li>Dynamic trust management</li>
          <li>Multi-agent AI</li>
          <li>Secure networking</li>
          <li>Integrated development process</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-8">
          This creates a high-assurance platform that adapts to evolving threats and technological advancements, making it a highly secure and versatile platform for various uses across multiple markets for decades to come.
